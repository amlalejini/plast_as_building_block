# Phenotypic Plasticity as an Evolutionary Building Block for Complexity

## Introduction

Phenotypic plasticity
  * What is it?
  * Why is it important?

Complex traits that require phenotypic plasticity
  * Examples (literature review): what complex traits build upon phenotypic plasticity?

The evolution of complex traits require evolutionary stepping stones.
  * Examples (literature): evolution of complex features
    * Darwin quote about complex traits building on other traits.
    * Examples (e.g. Lenski et al. 2003)

Plasticity as a building block for complexity
  * Examples (literature review)
  * Here, we explore the role of phenotypic plasticity in the evolution of complex features/traits.
  * Some motivation for this research:
    * Deeper understanding evolutionary processes
      * Biological systems hard, easier in digital evolution.
    * Improvements to evolutionary computation

Use Digital evolution to begin to address the following questions:
  * Questions:
    1. What are the effects of existing regulation of multiple traits on the evolution of more complex regulation of those same traits?
    2. What are the effects of existing regulation of multiple traits on the evolution of different and more complex, unregulated traits?
    3. What are the effects of existing regulation of multiple traits on the evolution of different and more complex, regulated traits?
    4. What are the effects of existing regulation of multiple traits on the evolution of complex coordination, like division of labor?
